### ðŸ“¦ `@localazy/strapi-frontend-admin-translations`

## Strapi Frontend Admin Translations Boilerplate by Localazy

</br>

The public project for managing translations is [Strapi Frontend Admin](https://localazy.com/p/strapi-frontend-admin) (you can contribute).

This repository will be updated frequently with new translations and Strapi version updates.

</div>

## ðŸš€ How to use

The repository is currently updated manually. 

```javascript
  "readKey": "a8120023039112376500-1d4129ec12f08f85b6892bf0955ad0d3af9aaabdfff8770e2be4e54102ee9546"
```

The `readKey` is present in the `localazy.json` file, allowing anyone to update language resources using the Localazy CLI Tool by running the `localazy download` command.

```bash
localazy download
```

- To use these translations, follow the code example structure and update your `app.js` file.
- Then navigate to the **User Settings page** in **Strapi** to change the UI language.


## âœ… Available Languages

Strapi natively supports the following languages:

* ar (Arabic)
* fr (French)
* cs (Czech)
* de (German)
* dk (Danish)
* es (Spanish)
* he (Hebrew)
* id (Indonesian)
* it (Italian)
* ja (Japanese)
* ko (Korean)
* ms (Malay)
* nl (Dutch)
* no (Norwegian BokmÃ¥l)
* pl (Polish)
* pt-BR (Portuguese (Brazil))
* pt (Portuguese (Portugal))
* ru (Russian)
* sk (Slovak)
* sv (Swedish)
* th (Thai)
* tr (Turkish)
* uk (Ukrainian)
* vi (Vietnamese)
* zh-Hans (Chinese (Simplified))
* zh (Chinese (Traditional))

## ðŸ—’ Notes

* Strapi interprets Danish as "dk" instead of the correct ISO code "da".
* Strapi interprets Norwegian BokmÃ¥l as "no"; a more specific version should be used.
* Strapi interprets Traditional Chinese as "zh"; a more specific version should be used.

Localazy and this boilerplate resolve these issues (see `app.js`).

Currently, Strapi does not allow users to add other than the above languages.

- See [this issue](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/pull/13096) for more details.
- This will be fixed in the one of the future Strapi releases.
